MVC Architecture

#######################

--> MVC Stands for Model, view, Controller

--> It is a 3 layered architecture used to build application

--> Using this architecture we divided application into following layers
	
	a. View - All front-end code of your application we will keep that in view
	
	Exampl : html, jsp etc.
	
	b. Model - All database operations/ business logic we devlop in this layer
	
	c. Controller - It act as, mediator between view and model layer. 
		That is it takes data from the view and gives that model and vice versa.
		
	Practical Example - To add two number usgin MVC Architecture
	
		a. View - add.jsp
		b. Controller - Servlets (AddController.java)
		c. Model (Service layer) - Java classes with logical implementation - AddService
